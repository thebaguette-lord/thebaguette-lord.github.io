        <h3>Background</h3>	
        <b>This section may contain spoilers from the story, please read at your own risk!</b><br>
        Leo/need's bassist. She is determined about music and is often misunderstood due to being a lone wolf who dislikes clinginess. Shiho deeply cares for her band members, alongside who she has chased and achieved the dream of becoming professional musicians.<br>
        
        
        Shiho and Ichika, Saki, and Honami were friends as children. The group used to stargaze and play music, but because of Saki's hospitalization during middle school, Shiho's relationships with Ichika and Honami became strained. Eventually Shiho was placed in a class where she didn't know anyone. Her classmates tried to befriend Shiho, but she had no interest in them, giving her a bad reputation. Due to the rumors about her, she made Ichika and Honami stop talking to her, in fear of her reputation poorly affecting them. After Saki returns to school and they access the School SEKAI, the group slowly reunites and forms Leo/need, named after the meteor shower they watched together as children.<br>
        
        When Shiho was in middle school, she joined the light music club, but became frustrated by the other members lack of dedication. When she brought this up to the other members, the group got into an argument, leading them to split up and tarnishing Shiho's reputation even more.<br>
        
        Shiho's mother is a koto instructor, and Shiho learned how to play when she was young. Her father used to be the guitarist of a famous band.<br>
        
        As a first year, Shiho was classmates with Minori and Kohane in class 1-A. As a second year, she is classmates with Saki and Emu in class 2-B and part of the Animal Care committee with Minori.<br>
        
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        Shiho has green eyes, a resting poker face, and short, scruffy gray hair. Her voice is sharp and tomboyish.<br>
        
        <h3>Casual Outfit</h3>
        In her first year, her casual outfit consists of an oversized dark green hoodie with white lining, white socks and black and white sneakers. Her hoodie says "Everything Started from here." with the number "487" between the text, written in a gold-yellow.<br>
        
        In her second year, it consists of a blue and grey denim jacket over a white hoodie with a black number "14" written on it. Her shorts are dark brown and her sneakers are black.<br>
        
        <h3>Unit Outfit</h3>
        Her band uniform consists of a white, sharp-ended blouse with a red and white striped tie in the form of a bow, covered with a cropped, light green jersey with a purple and white line on her right arm, a black glove on her left hand, a black skirt with light green lining and black sneakers with black cropped socks. One of the pleats on her skirt is also a light green.<br>
        
        Her second band uniform heavily resembles a school uniform. She wears a green, black and grey unbuttoned lapel over a white, collared, mostly buttoned shirt, apart from the very last one at the bottom. Just under her collar is a red tie with white strips. She wears two leather bracelets on each wrist, one of them having a star charm. Her skirt is pleated with a green trim and a green belt with a gold trim hanging from the left side. Her boots are short grey and laced also with black socks.<br>
        
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        Shiho is introverted and dislikes interacting with others. She immerses herself in her hobbies and doesn't care what other people think about her. Although she is introverted, she is not unkind, and is usually willing to help others. She is a straightforward person and speaks bluntly. Her cold, detached demeanor comes from her fear of hurting and dragging down those around her. Because of her aloof persona, rumors about her have previously spread throughout school, most of which claiming her to be a bully.<br>
        
        While Shiho cares for her childhood friends deeply, she is not afraid to be tough on them when she feels it's necessary. She does not give praise often, and when she does, it's usually<br> 
        short and frank. She takes band practice very seriously, and often leads the group due to her<br>
        having the most experience. She wants to pursue music as a professional someday.<br>
